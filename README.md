## 💡 Personalized "For You" Page

The `/src/app/for-you/page.tsx` dynamically generates a feed for each user by:

- 🔍 **Retrieving Preferences**: From Firebase — topics of interest, saved content, interaction history.
- 🤖 **Running AI Flow**: `/src/ai/flows/for-you-feed-generator.ts` uses user signals + trending metadata.
- 🧱 **Rendering Articles**: Responsive layout showcasing summaries, visuals, and engagement options.

This feature increases time-on-site and deepens user relevance.
